import "@uploadfly/react-widget/dist/style.css";

        <button>Upload a file</button>
      </UfWidget>
    </div>
  );
}

export default App;
```

## Props

The `UfWidget` component accepts the following props:

- `apiKey` (string, required): Your UploadFly API key. Preferably an [upload access](/quickstart/authentication#1-upload-access) key.
- `filename` (string, optional): The name of the file to be uploaded.
- `maxFileSize` (string, optional): The maximum allowed file size for upload, specified as a string (e.g., "6.9MB").
- `allowedFileTypes` (array of strings, optional): An array of allowed file types for upload (e.g., ["jpeg", "png"]).

- `onUploadComplete` (function, optional): A callback function that receives upload completion data.
- `accentColor` (string, optional): Custom accent color for styling the widget (default is `#f35815`).

## Event Handlers

- `onUploadComplete(data: object)`: A callback function called when the upload process is completed. It receives an object containing the following properties:
  - `status` (number): HTTP status code of the upload response.
  - `success` (boolean): Indicates whether the upload was successful.
  - `data` (object): Information about the uploaded file, including:
    - `url` (string): URL to the uploaded file.
    - `name` (string): Name of the uploaded file.
    - `size` (number): Size of the uploaded file in bytes.
    - `type` (string): MIME type of the uploaded file.
    - `path` (string): Path to the uploaded file.

## Attribution

By default, the widget includes an attribution link to UploadFly. If you wish to hide this attribution, set the `hideAttribution` prop to `true`.
